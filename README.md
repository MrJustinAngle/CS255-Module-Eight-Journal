- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The client was DriverPass. DriverPass wanted an application that would help people learn how to drive and successfully pass their driving tests. They wanted a system that had training and practice tests online that the users could purchase and use. They wanted this project to allow users to connect with teachers allowing them to make appointments with those teachers.
    
- What did you do particularly well?

   I believe I did everything very well. I was able to take the interview notes and turn it into outlines with the relationships of each object. I was also able to map out who would have access to which functions and how the system would work.
    
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

   I think I would make changes to my UML case diagram in project 2. I would add more details of what everyone should have access to and how the system works.
    
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

   To be able to implement the user's needs in the system design. I first went over the transcript ensuring I captured every need DriverPass needed. And I made sure to add those needs in the system designs. It's important to consider the user needs because they are the ones who will be using the application. And if the application is successful you're more likely will have a repeat customer.
    
- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I'm still new in the designing software department. However, I usually approach it by looking at the needs the software needs to meet and cater my programming to those needs, ensuring I'm meeting each and every one of them. I think I will continue with this strategy in the future and keep updating it as needed.
